According to 'How robots change the world' by Oxford Economics, Robots could take over 20 million jobs by 2030. It is no longer a question of if robotics will shape our future, but how much and in what ways. This makes teaching young students about robotics all the more important. 

This is the bachelor thesis of four mechanical engineering students of the 3mE faculty at the Delft Technical University. This bachelor thesis was made under the supervision of ir. Ehsan Hosseini and ir. Andr√© van der Kraan and Martin Klomp of the Cognitive Robotics Department.

This report describes the design project called 'Building a low-cost Quadruped SpotMicro Robot'. The Cognitive Robotics project has the aim to design a low-cost robot that uses components of the Mirte Robotics project. SpotMicro is an opensource robot which takes design elements from the famous spot robot by Boston Dynamics. There are a number of existing designs for the SpotMicro, of which we chose one. Therefore, the design challenge of this project is not in the physical design of the robot but in coding and programing
