In order to predict the minimal required motor torque, multiple
theoretical models were be made. The first model was  a
motion study in Solidworks. Next, a dynamical kinematics
model was be made with the use of Python. From the findings
of the theoretical models, a motor selection was done and
implemented in an actual robot. And lastly, in order to validate
the models, a video analysis of the motion of the robot was
done with the use of Coach 7 and Python.

The SolidWorks motion study modeled the following movements and returned the torques that were deliverd by the motors in the joints. 
The results of this motion study are plotted in the graphs below.
