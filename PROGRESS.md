# Plan

## Design choices
As described in the scope this project will focus on the feasability of using existing designs of the SpotMicro and replacing hardware compononents.

First an existing desing has to be chosen, there are three well built easy and readily available designs available on GitHub:

- 1
- 2
- Michael Kubina

The choice was made for the design of Michael Kubina, the design is spaceous and offers flexibility when working with different than prescribed hardware components. The design offers a variety of circuit boards to be printed and placed on the "back" of the SpotMicro. In this GitHub repository - insert link here - his original CAD files are also added allowing for easy changes to be made in the CAD files for eventual adaptation of the design.
