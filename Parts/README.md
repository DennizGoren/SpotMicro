# Parts and Components

All the STL's that were used to build the robot are from the SpotMicroESP32 project of Michael Kubina and can be found here:

The parts that were customized to house the Mirte hardware are all in this folder. They include a mounting plate for the OrangePi Zero, a 5 volt step-down converter and the screw terminals that were used to divide the current to the servo motors. Also a holder for the step-down converter was designed and adjustments were made to the battery holder to house the smaller 6.6 volt lipo battery that was used for this project.
